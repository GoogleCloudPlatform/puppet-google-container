## Module Description

This Puppet module manages the resource of Google Container Engine.
You can manage its resources using standard Puppet DSL and the module will,
under the hood, ensure the state described will be reflected in the Google
Cloud Platform resources.

## Setup

To install this module on your Puppet Master (or Puppet Client/Agent), use the
Puppet module installer:

    puppet module install google-gcontainer

Optionally you can install support to _all_ Google Cloud Platform products at
once by installing our "bundle" [`google-cloud`][bundle-forge] module:

    puppet module install google-cloud

## Usage

### Credentials

All Google Cloud Platform modules use an unified authentication mechanism,
provided by the [`google-gauth`][] module. Don't worry, it is automatically
installed when you install this module.

```puppet
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
  ],
}
```

Please refer to the [`google-gauth`][] module for further requirements, i.e.
required gems.

### Examples

### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`gcontainer_cluster`][]:
    A Google Container Engine cluster.
* [`gcontainer_node_pool`][]:
    NodePool contains the name and configuration for a cluster's node pool.
    Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM's), with a common configuration and
    specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a
    set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference
    them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to
    accommodate the workload.
* [`gcontainer_kube_config`][]:
    Generates a compatible Kuberenetes '.kube/config' file

### About output only properties

Some fields are output-only. It means you cannot set them because they are
provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Yet they are still useful to ensure the
value the API is assigning (or has assigned in the past) is still the value you
expect.

For example in a DNS the name servers are assigned by the Google Cloud DNS
service. Checking these values once created is useful to make sure your upstream
and/or root DNS masters are in sync.  Or if you decide to use the object ID,
e.g. the VM unique ID, for billing purposes. If the VM gets deleted and
recreated it will have a different ID, despite the name being the same. If that
detail is important to you you can verify that the ID of the object did not
change by asserting it in the manifest.

### Parameters

#### `gcontainer_cluster`

A Google Container Engine cluster.

#### Example

```puppet
gcontainer_cluster { "mycluster-${cluster_id}":
  ensure             => present,

    username => 'cluster_admin',
    password => 'my-secret-password',
  },
  node_config        => {
    machine_type => 'n1-standard-4', # we want a 4-core machine for our cluster
    disk_size_gb => 500,             # ... and a lot of disk space
  },
  zone               => 'us-central1-a',

##### `name`

  The name of this cluster. The name must be unique within this project
  and zone, and can be up to 40 characters. Must be Lowercase letters,
  numbers, and hyphens only. Must start with a letter. Must end with a
  number or a letter.

##### `description`

  An optional description of this cluster.

##### `initial_node_count`

Required.  The number of nodes to create in this cluster. You must ensure that
  your Compute Engine resource quota is sufficient for this number of
  instances. You must also have available firewall and routes quota. For
  requests, this field should only be used in lieu of a "nodePool"
  object, since this configuration (along with the "nodeConfig") will be
  used to create a "NodePool" object with an auto-generated name. Do not
  use this and a nodePool at the same time.

##### `node_config`

  Parameters used in creating the cluster's nodes.
  For requests, this field should only be used in lieu of a "nodePool"
  object, since this configuration (along with the "initialNodeCount")
  will be used to create a "NodePool" object with an auto-generated
  name. Do not use this and a nodePool at the same time. For responses,
  this field will be populated with the node configuration of the first
  node pool. If unspecified, the defaults are used.

##### node_config/machine_type
  The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type (e.g.
  n1-standard-1).  If unspecified, the default machine type is
  n1-standard-1.

##### node_config/disk_size_gb
  Size of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB. The
  smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. If unspecified, the default
  disk size is 100GB.

##### node_config/oauth_scopes
  The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the
  node VMs under the "default" service account.
  The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by
  default are not included:
  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute is required for mounting
  persistent storage on your nodes.
  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only is required
  for communicating with gcr.io (the Google Container Registry).
  If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud
  Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will
  be added.

##### node_config/service_account
  The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node
  VMs.  If no Service Account is specified, the "default" service
  account is used.

##### node_config/metadata
  The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster.
  Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than
  128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the
  metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not
  conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of
  the four reserved keys: "instance-template", "kube-env",
  "startup-script", and "user-data"
  Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted
  by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed
  on them is that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32
  KB.
  The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.
  An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
  Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

##### node_config/image_type
  The image type to use for this node.  Note that for a given image
  type, the latest version of it will be used.

##### node_config/labels
  The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value pairs) to be applied to
  each node. These will added in addition to any default label(s)
  that Kubernetes may apply to the node. In case of conflict in
  label keys, the applied set may differ depending on the Kubernetes
  version -- it's best to assume the behavior is undefined and
  conflicts should be avoided. For more information, including usage
  and the valid values, see:
  http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/user-guide/labels.html
  An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
  Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

## Development

### Automatically Generated Files

Some files in this package are automatically generated by
[Magic Modules][magic-modules].

We use a code compiler to produce this module in order to avoid repetitive tasks
and improve code quality. This means all Google Cloud Platform Puppet modules
use the same underlying authentication, logic, test generation, style checks,
etc.

Learn more about the way to change autogenerated files by reading the
[CONTRIBUTING.md][] file.

### Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md][] for more information on how to get
started.

### Running tests

This project contains tests for [rspec][], [rspec-puppet][] and [rubocop][] to
verify functionality. For detailed information on using these tools, please see
their respective documentation.

#### Testing quickstart: Ruby > 2.0.0

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rubocop
```
